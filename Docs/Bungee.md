Bungee Bridge
-------------

### Setup

- Set the `Bungee server address` and `Bungee server port` in your Depenizen config to your Bungee proxy server's details.
- Make sure your Bungee config sees the real address of the end server, not an additional relay proxy (the address will be used to validate the connection).
- Install the Bungee-side plugin (you don't need to configure anything, just toss it in the Bungee plugins folder).
    - Download builds of that here: https://ci.citizensnpcs.co/job/DepenizenBungee/
